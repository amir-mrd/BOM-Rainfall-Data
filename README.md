# BOM-Rainfall-Data
Using *Bureau of Meteorology* Climate Data Online, I am investigating the daily rainfall for Brisbane and identifying significant periods of time during the last 3 years. Once significant periods of time are found, I compare Brisbane's rainfall for those periods with Sydney. I will then elaborate on what insights can be gained from this analysis, and who might benefit from them?

The data can be accessed directly from BOM website :
